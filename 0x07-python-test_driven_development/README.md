Test-driven development is a project conducted as part of Full Stack Software Engineering studies. Its primary objective is to gain proficiency in using docstrings to create and implement tests in Python.

Technologies Used:
- Python scripts are written using Python 3.4.3.
- C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4.
- The project was tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Project Files:
1. `0-add_integer.py`: This file contains a function that adds two integers, and it includes Doctest examples in the `tests/0-add_integer.txt` file.

2. `2-matrix_divided.py`: This file contains a function that divides all elements of a matrix, and it includes Doctest examples in the `tests/2-matrix_divided.txt` file.

3. `3-say_my_name.py`: This file contains a function that prints "My name is <first name> <last name>," and it includes Doctest examples in the `tests/3-say_my_name.txt` file.

4. `4-print_square.py`: This file contains a function that prints a square using the "#" character, and it includes Doctest examples in the `tests/4-print_square.txt` file.

5. `5-text_indentation.py`: This file contains a function that prints a text with two new lines after each occurrence of ".", "?," or ":", and it includes Doctest examples in the `tests/5-text_indentation.txt` file.

6. `tests/6-max_integer_test.py`: This is a file containing unit tests for the `max_integer` function.

7. `100-matrix_mul.py`: This file contains a function that multiplies two matrices, and it includes Doctest examples in the `tests/100-matrix_mul.txt` file.

8. `101-lazy_matrix_mul.py`: This file contains a function that multiplies two matrices using the NumPy module, and it includes Doctest examples in the `tests/101-lazy_matrix_mul.txt` file.

9. `102-python.c`: This file contains a function that prints Python strings.

These files collectively make up the Test-driven development project, which focuses on testing and implementing various functions in Python.
